Pathfinder: A JavaScript Learning Adventure
üöÄ Introduction
Pathfinder is an interactive, gamified quiz application designed to test and reinforce your knowledge of fundamental JavaScript concepts. Structured as a "path" with multiple levels, it provides a fun and engaging way to learn, from basic functions to more advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming and data structures.

This project is built as a single, self-contained HTML file, making it incredibly portable and easy to run. It uses Firebase for backend services, allowing for user authentication and persistent progress saving.

‚ú® Features

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6 Modules)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Icons: Lucide Icons

Backend & Database: Google Firebase

Firebase Authentication

Firestore Database

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Because this is a single-file application, setup is minimal. However, to enable the online progress-saving features, you must connect it to your own Firebase project.

Create a Firebase Project: If you don't have one already, create a new project at the Firebase Console.

Get Your Config:

In your Firebase project, create a new "Web App".

Navigate to Project Settings > General > Your apps.

Find the firebaseConfig object and copy it.

Update the Code:

Open the index7.html file.

Find the const firebaseConfig = { ... }; declaration within the <script type="module"> tag.

Replace the entire placeholder object with the one you copied from your Firebase project.

Enable Authentication Methods:

In the Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Sign-in method.

Enable the Email/Password, Google, and Anonymous sign-in providers.

Configure Firestore Rules:

Go to Firestore Database > Rules.

For testing purposes, you can set the rules to be open. This is not secure for a production application.

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Play
Simply open the index7.html file in any modern web browser.

To save progress online: Click the "Login / Register" button to create an account or sign in.

To play as a guest: Click "Continue as Guest" or simply start the quiz. Your progress will be saved in your browser.

Enjoy your journey to becoming a JavaScript Pathfinder!
